    a bridge too far
    a dime a dozen
    add insult to injury
    all over the place
    be as it may
    beat around the bush
    bite the bullet
    bite off more than you can chew
    blessing in disguise
    blow off steam
    break a leg
    call it a day
    can of worms
    couldn't care less
    cut corners
    cut to the chase
    dial down
    draw a line
    drop a hint
    easier said than done
    eat like a horse
    fair and square
    fall into place
    fall through the tracks
    give something a go
    give something a whirl
    go cold turkey
    go over your head
    go overboard
    go the extra mile
    go the way of the dodo
    have bigger fish to fry
    hit the nail on the head
    hit the sack
    if worse comes to worst
    ignorance is bliss
    in the nick of time
    jack of all trades
    jump at the chance
    jump for joy
    kangaroo court
    keep an eye out
    keep someone company
    keep tabs on
    keep your cool
    kid around
    knock it off
    laughing stock
    lay off
    lay the groundwork
    leave someone in the dust
    light at the end of the tunnel
    like two peas in a pod
    love at first sight
    nip something in the bud
    no harm, no foul
    no pain, no gain
    no way
    not so fast
    off the top of my head
    off your rocker
    on thin ice
    once in a blue moon
    pick up the pieces
    piece of cake
    pitch-perfect
    pixel perfect
    play by ear
    play on words
    play someone like a fiddle
    point fingers
    poster child
    pot calling the kettle black
    pour cold water on
    pour your heart out
    pull yourself together
    put lipstick on a pig
    read between the lines
    rip off
    rue the day
    spill the beans
    stand a chance
    stand behind
    steal someone's thunder
    steal the show
    stretch the truth
    stroke of luck
    the best of both worlds
    the elephant in the room
    the last straw
    the whole nine yards
    to make a long story short
    top of the line
    turn a blind eye
    when push comes to shove
    wild goose chase
    word of mouth
    worth one's salt
    you can say that again
