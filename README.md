## Contribute

You can help through:

- **Programming.** Just take an [issue](https://gitlab.com/enjoyingfoss/parlera/-/issues) and assign it to yourself. If you want to work on a feature that doesn't have an associated issue yet, report a new issue first.
- **Translating Parlera's UI text.** Take the [app_en.arb language file](https://gitlab.com/enjoyingfoss/parlera/-/blob/master/lib/l10n/app_en.arb) and translate all the English entries on the right side to your language. To submit a translation, either submit a merge request or create a new issue here and attach your translation.
- **Adding words and categories for your language.** Take the file relevant to your language from the [`assets/data` folder](https://gitlab.com/enjoyingfoss/parlera/-/tree/master/assets/data) and add new words and categories to it. If a file doesn't exist for your language, create it! To submit your changes, either submit a merge request or create a new issue here and attach your translation. Rules for which entries you can submit are listed below.

### Words you can submit

When you submit entries, make sure that they are:

* Known by the most adult native speakers of a specific language (for country-specific words, use the *Region* column)
* In their most basic form â€” just like dictionary entries (i.e. singular, first person, infinitive, ...)
* Family-friendly
* Not derogatory
* Not originally from works under copyright (e.g. "Harry Potter" would not be accepted)

Contributions might not be accepted even if they meet the rules here.
