## Contribute

You can help through:

- **Programming.** Just take an [issue](https://gitlab.com/enjoyingfoss/parlera/-/issues) and assign it to yourself. If you want to work on a feature that doesn't have an associated issue yet, report a new issue first.
- **Contributing new terms.** Parlera uses [Parlerlist](https://gitlab.com/enjoyingfoss/parlerlist) for its words. See its [README](https://gitlab.com/enjoyingfoss/parlerlist/-/blob/main/README.md) for how to contribute.
- **Translating Parlera's UI text.** Take the [app_en.arb language file](https://gitlab.com/enjoyingfoss/parlera/-/blob/master/lib/l10n/app_en.arb) and translate all the English entries on the right side to your language. To submit a translation, either file a merge request or create a new issue and attach your translation.
- **Adding words and categories for your language.** See the [Parlerlist](https://gitlab.com/enjoyingfoss/parlerlist) [README](https://gitlab.com/enjoyingfoss/parlerlist/-/blob/main/README.md) for how to contribute.
