# Parlera

Parlera is an open-source word guessing party game.

## Join the conversation

If you want to help out or even just ask a question, you can reach the community at https://matrix.to/#/#parlera:matrix.org .

## Contribute

You can help through:

- **Programming.** Just take an [issue](https://gitlab.com/enjoyingfoss/parlera/-/issues) and assign it to yourself. If you want to work on a feature that doesn't have an associated issue yet, report a new issue first.
- **Translating.** Go to [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/parlera/) and choose or add your language.

### Words you can submit

When you submit entries, make sure that they are:

* Known by the most adult native speakers of a specific language (for country-specific words, use the *Region* column)
* In their most basic form â€” just like dictionary entries (i.e. singular, first person, infinitive, ...)
* Family-friendly
* Not derogatory
* Not originally from works under copyright (e.g. "Harry Potter" would not be accepted)

Contributions might not be accepted even if they meet the rules here.
