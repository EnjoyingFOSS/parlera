# Parlera

Parlera is an open-source word guessing party game.

## Join the conversation

If you want to help out or even just ask a question, you can reach the community at https://matrix.to/#/#parlera:matrix.org .

## Donate
Support the project via **[Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/Parlera/)**. Every bit helps. The more money is donated, the more time I can afford to work on this project.

## Contribute

You can help through:

- **Programming.** Just take an [issue](https://gitlab.com/enjoyingfoss/parlera/-/issues) and assign it to yourself. If you want to work on a feature that doesn't have an associated issue yet, report a new issue first.
- **Translating.** Go to [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/parlera/) and choose or add your language.
- **Contributing word list.** Create a new word list inside of Parlera, export it as a file, and submit the file via an issue report at the [Parlera Categories repository](https://gitlab.com/enjoyingfoss/parlera-categories/-/tree/main/). (More info in the README there.)

### Words you can submit

When you submit entries, make sure that they are:

* Known by the most adult native speakers of a specific language
* In their most basic form â€” just like dictionary entries (i.e. singular, first person, infinitive, ...)
* Family-friendly
* Not derogatory

Contributions might not be accepted even if they meet the rules here.
